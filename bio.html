			<p>I am currently a student studying at Eastern Washington University in the pursuit of a degree in Visual Communication and Design. My hope is to become fluent in both front and back end design work to better my ability to communicate and work well in different team situations. </p><br/>

			<p>When I'm not spending my time designing or anxiously worrying about different tasks, you can find me working at the PUB Computer Lab on my college campus or drawing in my dorm room. </p><br/>

			 <p>I like books and movies that “tear out your heart and tape it back together again,” as well as good video games and music. I also looked at 10 different websites about how to write a good bio and still managed to not quite make the cut. I turned 20 on the 10th of February, and still don't really know how to handle that.<p><br/>
